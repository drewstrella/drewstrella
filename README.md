USF Graduate Student with a degree in Physics
Working as a Freelance Data Science Software Deleloper
Currently working on my Masters in Engineering

I have experience with Python, particularly in Data Science

- ðŸŒ± I am seeking to grow my career in Data Science

I was first introduced to coding through my Physics Degree where I took courses focused on Python for computation, 
analysis, and visualization to prepare students for research environments. I also used Python in my coursework and labratory experience.

During my Masters I have taken Graduate level courses covering object-oriented programming, functional 
programming, data structures & environments, Pandas, Dataframes, predictive analytics (regression and classification) using classic and 
machine learning algorithms.
